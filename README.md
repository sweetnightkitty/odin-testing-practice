## Getting Started

Before getting started make sure you have the latest version of npm installed.

I recommend downloading Node Version Manager (NVM) first and then downloading Node.

For quick and easy instructions on how to download nvm and set up node: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installing-node-js

Next you will need to fork this repository to your Github account, and then use the git clone command to clone a copy to your local environment.

### Download Jest & Babel

If you wish to run tests to confirm their performance or write additional tests you will need to download Jest & Babel:

Install the latest version of Jest:
```
npm init jest@latest
```

Then install Babel with
```
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```
